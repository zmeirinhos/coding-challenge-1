# StratumFive - Coding Challenge

### Install:

Clone this respository, run `npm install` and run the program with `node index.js ships.txt` (the last parameter is the file or files with instructions to run.


### Considerations:

Have to say that this was quite simple, but it took me longer than I expected because there were things I didn't remember about node.js's modules. And a negative modulo... Shouldn't program at the end of a long day, the brain doesn't work so well. Also, I'm using a new mac computer that I got recently, and I find it very awkward to use. Anyway, excuses.

The test was good fun though!
